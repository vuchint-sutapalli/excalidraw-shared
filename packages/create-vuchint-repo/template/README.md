# Vuchint Repo Starter

This is a monorepo starter bootstrapped with `create-vuchint-repo`.

## Using this example

Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-vuchint-repo@latest
```

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build
yarn dlx turbo build
pnpm exec turbo build
```

You can build a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo build --filter=docs

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo build --filter=docs
yarn exec turbo build --filter=docs
pnpm exec turbo build --filter=docs
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev
yarn exec turbo dev
pnpm exec turbo dev
```

You can develop a specific package by using a [filter](https://turborepo.com/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters):

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo dev --filter=web

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo dev --filter=web
yarn exec turbo dev --filter=web
pnpm exec turbo dev --filter=web
```

### Remote Caching

> [!TIP]
> Vercel Remote Cache is free for all plans. Get started today at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/signup?/signup?utm_source=remote-cache-sdk&utm_campaign=free_remote_cache).

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.com/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup?utm_source=turborepo-examples), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo

# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo login

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo login
yarn exec turbo login
pnpm exec turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your Turborepo:

```
# With [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation) installed (recommended)
turbo link

# Without [global `turbo`](https://turborepo.com/docs/getting-started/installation#global-installation), use your package manager
npx turbo link
yarn exec turbo link
pnpm exec turbo link
```

steps followed

Create Your Project Template
Your CLI needs a "template" to copy. This will be a cleaned-up version of your current project.

Create a template directory inside your new CLI package: packages/create-vuchint-repo/template.
Copy the entire contents of your project root (my-turborepo) into this new template directory.
Crucially, clean up the template:
Delete all node_modules, .turbo, dist, and .next directories from the template.
Delete the packages/create-vuchint-repo directory from inside the template (to avoid infinite recursion!).
Rename template/.gitignore to template/gitignore. This is a common trick because npm will not publish a file named .gitignore. Our script will rename it back.
Step 4: Install Dependencies
Now, go back to your project root and run pnpm install. This will detect the new package and install its dependencies (fs-extra, prompts, etc.).

bash
pnpm install
Step 5: Test Your CLI Locally
Before publishing, you should test it on your machine.

Build the CLI:
bash
pnpm --filter create-vuchint-repo build
Link the package globally: This makes your create-vuchint-repo command available everywhere on your system, pointing to your local code.
bash
pnpm link --global ./packages/create-vuchint-repo
Run your command: Navigate to a different directory (e.g., cd ..) and run your new command!
bash
create-vuchint-repo my-test-project
This will create a new folder my-test-project with your entire monorepo structure ready to go.
Step 6: Publish to npm
Once you're happy with it, you can publish it to the npm registry.

Log in to your npm account (create one if you don't have one):
bash
npm login
Navigate into your CLI package and publish it. The --access public flag is needed for scoped packages if you're on a free npm plan. Your package isn't scoped, but it's good practice for public packages.
bash
cd packages/create-vuchint-repo
pnpm publish --access public
That's it! After publishing, anyone in the world (including you) can run npx create-vuchint-repo@latest to bootstrap a new project using your template.
